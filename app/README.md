## What To Do
1. Clone the repository: git clone "https://github.com/Teezy24/MAP-Winter-School.git"
2. Understand the structure of the project:
 - In the MainActivity.kt file is where the main code is written.
 - In Line 52(navbar config) and 113(Compose Declaration) you can see that the tabs are being called through the function of each file.
3. Pick a Screens defined by a file that you want to work on and communicate it on the group
4. Ensure the core functionality is working thoroughly the MainActivity.kt file.
5. when in need of a backend you can for now just define whichever data needed in a resource file found in "app/src/main/res/values" and we will ensure the database structure corresponds to it.
6. Push every moderately significant change to the repository with a clear commit message.
7. If going through any issues for longer then 30 minutes, please reach out to the group for assistance.
